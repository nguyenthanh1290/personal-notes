# AvatarMe

## Identicon
Here is my version of below assigment. The idea is borrowed from Github. Identicons are simple 5×5 “pixel” sprites that are generated using a hash of the input text which can be an email, IP or whatever inputed. More here https://github.blog/2013-08-14-identicons.

Sample result of hashing my email address:

## Skills developed

* Hashing
* image manipulation

## Assigment

Given a personal information such as an email address, IP address, or a
public key, the program you will write needs to generate a unique avatar.
Imagine that you are building a new application and you want all of your
users to have a default and unique avatar. The package you will write
will allow the generation of such avatars. GitHub recently used such an
approach and generates an identicon for all new users who don't have a
gravatar account attached.
